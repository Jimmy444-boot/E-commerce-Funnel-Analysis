# üìä E-commerce-Funnel-Analysis

#### ü§å Business Problem
E-commerce businesses often lose users at different funnel stages:
Visit ‚Üí Product View ‚Üí Add to Cart ‚Üí Checkout ‚Üí Purchase

#### üìå Objective 
Identify where users drop off and recommend strategies to increase conversions.

#### This data was simulated
1Ô∏è‚É£ Purpose
The dataset simulates user interactions on an e-commerce platform to analyze funnel conversion, user behavior, and product performance. It is designed for SQL analysis, dashboarding, and data visualization.

3Ô∏è‚É£ Data Generation Methodology

1. Users & Events

   * 50 users (user_id 1001‚Äì1050) with 3‚Äì10 events each to simulate different engagement levels.

2. Sessions

   * Randomly assigned 1‚Äì5 sessions per user using the pattern: S<user_id><random_number>.

   * Supports session-based analysis.

3. Event Types

   * Randomly assigned: "view", "add_to_cart", "checkout", "purchase".

   * Models natural funnel drop-offs.

4. Products

   * product_id: random integer in a realistic range.

   * category: sampled from a predefined list.

   * price: uniformly random between $10‚Äì$500.

5. User Attributes

   * device and location sampled from predefined lists for segmentation.

6. Timestamps

  * Generated using Faker‚Äôs date_time_this_month() to simulate realistic user activity over one month.

7. Event IDs

  * Incremental unique ID for each row to maintain traceability.

4Ô∏è‚É£ Implementation Notes

* Language: Python 3.x

* Libraries: pandas, faker, random

* Output: CSV file or Pandas DataFrame, easily loaded into SQL or BI tools.

* Randomness: Can set a seed for reproducibility.

5Ô∏è‚É£ Use Cases

* Funnel conversion analysis (view ‚Üí add ‚Üí checkout ‚Üí purchase).

* Time-to-purchase analysis by product, category, device, or location.

* Segmentation analysis for marketing or UX improvements.

* Feeding into dashboards in Streamlit, Tableau, or Looker Studio.
