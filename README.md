# üìä E-commerce-Funnel-Analysis

## Project Description

This project simulates user interactions on an e-commerce platform to analyze customer behavior, conversion rates, and product performance. Using a synthetic dataset generated with Python and the Faker library, it captures user events such as product views, adding items to cart, checkouts, and purchases.

The dataset includes details such as user sessions, product categories, prices, devices, and locations, enabling segmentation, funnel analysis, and trend visualization. This project demonstrates skills in data generation, data cleaning, SQL analysis, and interactive dashboarding with Streamlit.

#### Key Highlights:

1. Created a realistic, reproducible dataset for funnel analysis.

2. Explored user behavior and drop-offs across different funnel stages.

3. Built an interactive dashboard for visualizing insights by product, category, device, and location.

4. Demonstrated end-to-end data analytics workflow: data generation ‚Üí analysis ‚Üí visualization ‚Üí insights.

#### Technologies Used:

    * Python (Faker, Pandas)

    * SQL

    * Data Visualization (google looker studio)

#### ü§å Business Problem
E-commerce businesses often lose users at different funnel stages:
Visit ‚Üí Product View ‚Üí Add to Cart ‚Üí Checkout ‚Üí Purchase

#### üìå Objective 
Identify where users drop off and recommend strategies to increase conversions.

#### ‚õîÔ∏è This data was simulated
1Ô∏è‚É£ Purpose
The dataset simulates user interactions on an e-commerce platform to analyze funnel conversion, user behavior, and product performance. It is designed for SQL analysis, dashboarding, and data visualization.

3Ô∏è‚É£ Data Generation Methodology

1. Users & Events

   * 50 users (user_id 1001‚Äì1050) with 3‚Äì10 events each to simulate different engagement levels.

2. Sessions

   * Randomly assigned 1‚Äì5 sessions per user using the pattern: S<user_id><random_number>.

   * Supports session-based analysis.

3. Event Types

   * Randomly assigned: "view", "add_to_cart", "checkout", "purchase".

   * Models natural funnel drop-offs.

4. Products

   * product_id: random integer in a realistic range.

   * category: sampled from a predefined list.

   * price: uniformly random between $10‚Äì$500.

5. User Attributes

   * device and location sampled from predefined lists for segmentation.

6. Timestamps

   * Generated using Faker‚Äôs date_time_this_month() to simulate realistic user activity over one month.

7. Event IDs

   * Incremental unique ID for each row to maintain traceability.

4Ô∏è‚É£ Implementation Notes

1. Language: Python 3.x

2. Libraries: pandas, faker, random

3. Output: CSV file or Pandas DataFrame, easily loaded into SQL or BI tools.

4. Randomness: Can set a seed for reproducibility.

5Ô∏è‚É£ Use Cases

1. Funnel conversion analysis (view ‚Üí add ‚Üí checkout ‚Üí purchase).

2. Time-to-purchase analysis by product, category, device, or location.

3. Segmentation analysis for marketing or UX improvements.

4. Feeding into dashboards in Streamlit, Tableau, or Looker Studio.
