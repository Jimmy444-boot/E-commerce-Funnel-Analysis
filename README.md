# üìä E-commerce-Funnel-Analysis

#### ü§å Business Problem
E-commerce businesses often lose users at different funnel stages:
Visit ‚Üí Product View ‚Üí Add to Cart ‚Üí Checkout ‚Üí Purchase

#### üìå Objective 
Identify where users drop off and recommend strategies to increase conversions.

#### This data was simulated
1Ô∏è‚É£ Purpose
The dataset simulates user interactions on an e-commerce platform to analyze funnel conversion, user behavior, and product performance. It is designed for SQL analysis, dashboarding, and data visualization.

3Ô∏è‚É£ Data Generation Methodology

Users and Events

50 users (user_id 1001‚Äì1050) are simulated.

Each user has 3‚Äì10 events generated randomly to mimic variable engagement.

Sessions

Session IDs combine user ID + random number (1‚Äì5 sessions per user).

Allows session-based analytics (e.g., session conversion rate).

Event Types

Randomly selected from ["view", "add_to_cart", "checkout", "purchase"].

Simulates natural funnel drop-offs ‚Äî not all users complete every stage.

Products

product_id: random integer in a realistic range.

category: sampled from a predefined list.

price: continuous uniform distribution between 10‚Äì500 USD.

User Attributes

device and location sampled from predefined lists to allow segmentation.

Timestamps

Generated using Faker‚Äôs date_time_this_month() to simulate events within a single month.

Enables time-based analysis and trend tracking.

4Ô∏è‚É£ Implementation Notes

* Language: Python 3.x

* Libraries: pandas, faker, random

* Output: CSV file or Pandas DataFrame, easily loaded into SQL or BI tools.

* Randomness: Can set a seed for reproducibility.

5Ô∏è‚É£ Use Cases

* Funnel conversion analysis (view ‚Üí add ‚Üí checkout ‚Üí purchase).

* Time-to-purchase analysis by product, category, device, or location.

* Segmentation analysis for marketing or UX improvements.

* Feeding into dashboards in Streamlit, Tableau, or Looker Studio.
